# **Implementation Notice and Intellectual Property Separation**

## **Scope of This Repository**

This repository contains **architectural descriptions, protocol specifications, and illustrative examples** related to decentralized, serverless peer-to-peer session establishment techniques. The materials herein are published as a **defensive disclosure and reference architecture** and are dedicated to the public domain as specified in the accompanying license.

This repository **does not contain** the source code, binaries, or proprietary implementation of any commercial software product.

## **Relationship to in8 and ioMetics LC**

The **in8 engine** is a copyrighted, commercially licensed software product owned by **ioMetics LC**. While in8 includes an independent implementation of concepts discussed in this repository, **in8 is not distributed, licensed, or disclosed here**.

Nothing in this repository grants any rights, express or implied, to:

* the in8 engine source code or binaries,
* internal architectures, algorithms, or data structures of in8,
* performance optimizations, heuristics, or engineering trade secrets of in8,
* application programming interfaces (APIs) or extension points of in8,
* trademarks, service marks, or branding associated with ioMetics LC.

---

## **Ideas vs. Implementations**

The materials in this repository disclose **general concepts, methods, and architectural patterns** intended to establish prior art and prevent patent encumbrance of decentralized networking techniques.

These disclosures do **not** include or convey any specific implementation of those concepts beyond **non-normative pseudocode and illustrative examples**. Any actual implementation—whether in in8 or elsewhere—requires independent engineering effort and may differ substantially in structure, performance, and behavior.

---

## **No License to Commercial Software**

Publication of this repository **does not**:

* license any portion of the in8 engine,
* place in8 or any other ioMetics LC software into the public domain,
* authorize copying, reverse engineering, or derivation of in8,
* waive any copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights held by ioMetics LC in its commercial products.

All rights in in8 and other ioMetics LC software are expressly reserved.

---

## **Defensive Publication Intent**

This repository is published to:

* establish prior art for decentralized, serverless peer-to-peer session establishment techniques;
* prevent the patenting of broadly described architectural concepts;
* encourage open, interoperable implementations by the community.

It is **not** intended to describe any single product implementation, including in8, in sufficient detail to enable reproduction.

## **Disclaimer**

This material is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind. References to possible implementations are illustrative only and do not represent commitments, disclosures, or product specifications of ioMetics LC.
